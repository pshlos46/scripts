# scripts/helpers

Several scripts/helpers that don't fit under anything else.

#### `empty-trash.sh`

as the name says, simple bash script to empty recycle bin periodically (use cron). Used in a CentOS 7 hosted in okeanos.grnet

#### `tabs.js`

**not my script**  
super useful script found somewhere in SO I think, to use with Adobe's Acrobat Reader. It adds a "remember my previous tabs/session" kind of feature

#### `oceanos-download.sh`

rsync bash script to download data from a remote server to your local machine automatically, without re-downloading the old data. Useful for remote seedboxes etc. Name comes from okeanos.grnet VM
